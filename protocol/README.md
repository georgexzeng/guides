A guide for getting things done.

Set up laptop
-------------

Install the latest version of Xcode from the App Store.

Set up your laptop with [this script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop)
and [these dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).

Create Rails app
----------------

Get Suspenders.

    gem install suspenders

Create the app.

    suspenders app --heroku true --github organization/app

Set up Rails app
----------------

Refer to individual apps for set-up directions.

Maintain a Rails app
--------------------

* Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your
  development machine or process.
* Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.
* Perform work in a feature branch.
* Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes.
* Use a [pull request] for code reviews.

[pull request]: http://goo.gl/Kmdee

Review code
-----------

A team member other than the author reviews the pull request. They follow
[Code Review](../code-review) guidelines to avoid
miscommunication.

They make comments and ask questions directly on lines of code in the Github
web interface or in Campfire.

For changes which they can make themselves, they check out the branch.

    git checkout <branch-name>
    rake db:migrate
    rake
    git diff staging/master..HEAD

They make small changes right in the branch, test the feature in browser,
run tests, commit, and push.

When satisfied, they comment on the pull request `Ready to merge.`

Merge
-----

Rebase interactively. Squash commits like "Fix whitespace" into one or a
small number of valuable commit(s). Edit commit messages to reveal intent.

    git fetch origin
    git rebase -i origin/master
    rake

View a list of new commits. View changed files. Merge branch into master.

    git log origin/master..<branch-name>
    git diff --stat origin/master
    git checkout master
    git merge <branch-name> --ff-only
    git push

Delete your remote feature branch.

    git push origin --delete <branch-name>

Delete your local feature branch.

    git branch --delete <branch-name>
